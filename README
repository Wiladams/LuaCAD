A minimalist CAD program that allows the user to create and view models using Lua

Summary
-------

For some, being able to create models directly from code is a good thing.
My goal in particular is to be able to send a design file to a rendering device
directly.  There it will be turned into the appropriate code for the device
for rendering.

In some cases, the final output might be .gcode, in others perhaps something else.
That means the .fab design files serve as a transport mechanism, rather than the
more traditional .stl files that are being used for 3D printing for example.

This gives much more flexibility in terms of what can be represented, and gives
the machine a chance to best optimize how it wants to render things.
